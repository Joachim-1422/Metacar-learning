This project is based on the metacar environment of @thibo73800 (https://github.com/thibo73800)

I made this project with TensorFlow.js

**USAGE :**
Open the index.html in your web browser.

Click on "Load trained agent" and load the metacar.json file

Click on "Train". The training is finish when the 24th epoch is finish (you can see it when opening the console).

Click on "Play"

You can also load your own data. If you click on "Gather on" the data will be collected when the max speed is reached.
When estimating that you've loaded enough data, click on "Gather off" and a new metacar.json will be downloaded.
